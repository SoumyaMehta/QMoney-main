This visual stock portfolio analyzer app helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.

Development Involved:

* Using Tiingoâ€™s REST APIs to fetch stock quotes and computing the annualized returns based on the holding period.
* Introducing multithreading to optimize app performance and refactoring the code for better exception handling.
