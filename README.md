### Pre-requisites
Java 1.8/1.11/1.15
Gradle 6
How to run the code
We have provided scripts to execute the code.

Use run.sh if you are on Linux/Unix/macOS Operating systems and run.bat if you are on Windows.

Internally both scripts run the following commands

gradle clean build -x test --no-daemon - This will create a jar file geektrust.jar in the build/libs folder.
java -jar build/libs/geektrust.jar sample_input/input1.txt - This will execute the jar file passing in the sample input file as the command line argument
Use the build.gradle file provided along with this project. Please change the main class entry under the jar task

 manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class' : 'com.geektrust.backend.App' //Change this to the main class of your program which will be executed
    }
in the build.gradle if your main class has changed.

## How to execute the unit tests
gradle clean test --no-daemon will execute the unit test cases.
